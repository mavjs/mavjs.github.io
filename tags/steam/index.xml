      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I was playing some games on Steam and closed it after I finished playing. Then I browsed around the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.humblebundle.com&#34;&gt;Humble Bundle&lt;/a&gt; and bought the Humble Indie Bundle 9 since I wanted  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markoftheninja.com&#34;&gt;Mark of the Ninja&lt;/a&gt;, so to redeem it I switched on Steam. But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t starting up. So, opened it from terminal and got some errors, but those were there since ages and doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually affected the start up last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this morning, I was talking to a friend on IRC about it and he mentioned that you could just do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell-session&#34;&gt;    /usr/bin/steam --reset
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to reinstall and start again..and voilà it was indeed working again. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Note]: Another friend suggested to restart the router, not sure how effective that would have been though. :P&lt;/p&gt;
